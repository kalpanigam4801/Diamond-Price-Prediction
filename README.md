# Diamond-Price-Prediction
The project aims at predicting the diamond prices using different Machine Learning algorithms. The diamonds dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. Four algorithms: Random Forest Regressor, K-Neighbors Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor and Particle Swarm Optimization are compared &amp; it is found that Random Forest Regressor provides the highest accuracy.
